### Fly.io Issues

Finally was able to merge my PR for User Sessions after a few more minor commits! Unfortunately, now I'm encountering fly.io issues.

1. My Github action encountered deployment issues to fly.io, but when I deploy from my machine directly, there are no deployment issues despite no changes in the fly.toml (deployment configuration file) or code.

2. Then, it seems the newly deployed app was being cached by fly.io where my new `REDIRECT_URI` value wasn't being updated to go to `/login` instead of `/login/discord-redirect`

3. Given that it seems to be cached, I tried deleting the deployed app and redoing the entire deployment process. However, now when I try to access the deployed app on fly.io, I get a connection reset message...

After spending so much time trying to debug this, I'll have to try again tomorrow. Very unfortunate with how fly.io is turning out since it seemed very functional early on. Not too much to write about today since most of it has been digging through fly.io logs and trying to debug what's going wrong.

### Next Steps
1. Try to figure out what's going wrong with my fly.io deployments, possibly redoing the deployment process again.
