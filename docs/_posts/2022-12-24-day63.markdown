### Paper Trader

1. Added sell request functionality

   - Now, sell requests can be made on the client that will update the database regarding the user's balance and shares owned.
   - Similar to the buy request function, but had to make sure quantity and balance values were properly updated (i.e. increase balance and decrease quantity).
     - Also added a separate function that checks the transaction table for total quantity of shares owned of a particulate stock for a user.
       - This function is a method in the transaction model file as it checks the transaction table.

2. Also changed my database query functions to run parallel rather than sequentially.

   - Since my functions to update the user's balance and the transaction table don't depend on each other, rather than having them run in sequence with an await at function declaration, I moved them to an array.

     ```
     // Before
      const balance = await db.query() // query balance table
      const transaction = await db.query() // query transaction table

      const result = balance.rows[0]
      return result

      // After

      const balance = db.query()
      const transaction = db.query()

      const result = [await balance, await transaction]
      return result[0].rows[0]

     ```

### Learnings/Clarifications

1. Originally I used a `RETURNING` clause in one of my database `SELECT` queries.
   - This caused an error as `RETURNING` is only necessary for `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` clauses as they normally don't return anything.

### Next Steps

1. Clean up docstrings, variable naming, and other minor language refactoring before submitting a PR for code review.
