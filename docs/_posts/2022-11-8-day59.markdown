### Paper Trader

1. Added Prettier VSCode extension to enforce style

2. Started working on the Success page component after a successful buy transaction

   - Reused what I learned from previous components on how to redirect and passing information to the new location so that was easy to set up
   - However, I noticed that if there's a trailing zero in my stock price or total cost, it gets removed when entered in the database and when passed to the client
     - Originally I tried manipulating the values before adding them to the database via `Number.toFixed(2)`, but that would convert the data type from `number` into `string`
     - So rather than changing the data types, I opted to use `toFixed(2)` when I'm displaying them on the `Success` page.
       - This works because they are `number` types already so I don't need to do `Number(price).toFixed(2)`

### Next Steps

1. Finish up the sell function
