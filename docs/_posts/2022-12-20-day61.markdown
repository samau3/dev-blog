### Paper Trader

1. Finished implementing the buy feature on the client side

   - Once a buy request is made, the user's balance is reduced by the total cost of the transaction.
   - Then the information about the transaction and updated balance is displayed on the successful request page.
   - Additionally, I updated the error messages sent from the server so they can be reused as error alerts on the client on the trading page.

2. Started working on the getQuote feature on the client side

   - Simply makes a request to the server to obtain stock information, which is then displayed below the Trading page form.
   - Still need to implement error handling for this
   - There was a weird issue I noticed while working on this, where my changes wouldn't be applied
     - The issue was my function didn't send the necessary `ticker` query parameter at first but after making the change, the error still kept happening
     - To fix this, I had to refresh my React client, which was surprising as I thought saving the file would have allowed for a hot reload with `npm start`
       - A potential explanation for this is that my function wasn't inside a `.jsx` file so `npm start` wouldn't apply those changes as it would for changes to `.jsx` files.

### Learnings

1. How to rename destructured variables from objects.
   ```
      const obj = { a : blue }
      const {a: favColor} = obj
      console.log(favColor) // blue
   ```
2. When I was trying to multiply two values in a SQL query, they were of type `varchar` instead of `numeric`, giving an error of `unknown * unknown`. To fix that, I had to use `CAST(value as numeric)`.

### Next Steps

1. Will need to figure out if the current implementation of the user's balance information is the best approach
   - Since the user's balance is only updated once a buy request is made on the client, there could be inaccurate balances if transactions were made directly to the database
     - This may not be a concern that needs to be addressed for this project, but it is a concern that may be worth exploring to implement.
2. Finish up the sell feature on the client side
3. May need to refactor the way errors are handled on my Trading page form to utilize form validation
