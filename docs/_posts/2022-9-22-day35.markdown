### Paper Trader

Taking a step back and thinking ahead today for the next few features to implement for Paper Trader.

1. React Error Handling will be next logical step after I wrap up the Express Error Handling.
    - At the moment the React client doesn't do anything when an error is encountered except hang, so with proper error handling this should mount a fallback component and have a better user experience.
2. I need to draft up a Database Schema to use for once I get ready for the database
    - There will likely be two tables, one for users and one for transactions
        - The user table will be very simple, such as username (as the primary key), funds, and probably last logged in
        - The transaction table will have a sequential (as the primary key), stock ticker, stock name, price, and transaction date
3. I will probably have to use a web scraper to get real time stock data as almost all stock APIs require a paid tier for that feature
    - Likely will use Puppeteer to stay within the JS language, but it might not be a bad idea to pick up Selenium with Python to refresh my knowledge with Python

### Next Steps
1. Draft up a database schema?
