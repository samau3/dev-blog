### Paper Trader

1. Started working on handling errors in React
    - Originally I thought I'd need to use React Error Boundaries, but that doesn't seem to be necessary? Though I did see someone use it as a [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50220675).
2. At the moment, errors are being created from my `axios` calls to the server for Discord OAuth.
    - My actual `axios` calls that I stored as methods on my `UserSession` class utilize try/catch which throws an `Error` in the catch block.
    - However, these throws show up in the console and doesn't trigger my try/catch blocks in my React components.
3. I'll need to tinker around some more to figure out where to properly throw these errors, or if I have to utilize the Error Boundaries.
    - The problem I see with utilizing the Error Boundaries is that will likely lead to massive refactoring of my components which may not be neccessary?

### Next Steps
1. Continue researching what's the best way to handle displaying errors on the React side.
