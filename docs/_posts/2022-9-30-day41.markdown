### Paper Trader

Continued working on the open PR for React error handling!

1. Mostly minor changes related to `console.logs` revealing potentially too much information so all `console.logs` have been removed from components
    - In addition to revealing too much information, the `console.logs` aren't needed now that debug what information is present in the components is not needed at the moment.
        - Of course, as components or features change, `console.logs` will be added then for development/debugging.

2. After I initally opened up the PR, I tried to start my local environment but encountered an error: 

    ~~~
    False expression: Non-string value passed to ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective, likely by a wrapping package working with an outdated resolveTypeReferenceDirectives signature. This is probably not a problem in TS itself.
    ~~~

    - This sudden error suprised me as there were no changes However, this added `ts-node` to the `package.json` in the `dependencies` section whereas `ts-node-dev` was added in the `devDependencies` section.
        - For consistency, moved both `ts-node` and `ts-node-dev` to be in `devDependencies`.

### Next Steps
1. Wrap up this PR and then start on the retros for the error handling.
