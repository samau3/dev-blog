### Paper Trader
**Fly.io CI/CD debugging**

Another full day trying to figure out deployment issues. Depsite the frustration, this should set the ground work for easier build and deployment when future features are implemented!

1. The first issue I tried tackling was leftover from yesterday, the Github Action that deletes the temporary Github Environments from a PR.
    - The action would find the environment, detect the number of deployments in it, and deactive them all before deleting the entire environment. That's the expected behavior.
    - However, when I ran the action, it would find the environment and detect the deployments, but would stop and spit out `**Error** Not Found`
        ![Github Action Error on PR Close](../../../../images/20220831/githubactionerror.png)
    - Oddly, when I pass in an environment value that doesn't exist, such as `non-existent-env`, it would run the action without issues
        ![Github Action Success on PR Close with nonexistent environment](../../../../images/20220831/githubactionsuccess.png)
    - Given the lack of progress of getting through this error, I decided to just comment out this portion of the Github Action to revist in the future
2. Next, I wanted to finally close the PR for Discord OAuth implementation, which meant I had to set the `BACKEND_BASE_URL` for React to know where the server is located. However, there wasn't anyway to set that on Firebase since it's more of a build time variable. Thus, I changed the `config.ts` to explictly set the `BACKEND_BASE_URL`.
    {%highlight javascript %}
    // previously 
    const BACKEND_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:8080"

    // currently
    const BACKEND_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
        ? "https://paper-trader.fly.dev/" // trailing "/"...
        : "http://localhost:8080";
    {%endhighlight%}

{:start="3"}
3. Now that the Github Actions for CI/CD were finalized, I merged the previous PR for Discord OAuth to main and watched the magic happen as everything was automatically rebuilt and redeployed!
    - Except when I tried the Discord OAuth flow on the deployed app, I got a `CORS` error and a `502` error. 
        - In the console, I noticed there was an extra `/` in the server URL, so made a quick change to that in the `config.ts`
    - However, after that change I still got errors after getting redirected from Discord
        - So I went to dig through the logs on `fly` and noticed my `redirect_uri` was still saying `localhost`...
4. I knew my Firebase React frontend is in production as the Discord OAuth authorization confirmation page showed the deployed URL. Which meant my deployed backend on `fly` doesn't have `NODE_ENV='production'`.
    - After tons of searching and digging into the docs, I found an [open issue for the Github Action](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl-actions/issues/9) I was using that was very similar to my problem.
    - Based on the discussion, I added `NODE_ENV="production"` as both an `env` variable and a `[build.args]` sections of the `fly.toml` file. 
5. With these changes, I can wrap up CI/CD for now such that adding new features and expanding the app will deploy automatically once changes are made to the main branch.
    - Of course, tests need to be added to the CI/CD pipeline later on...

### Next Steps
1. Can finally go back to working out user sessions!
