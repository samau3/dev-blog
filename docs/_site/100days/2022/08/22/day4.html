<p><strong>Discord OAuth</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>I brought over parts of the Discord OAuth code to my React Paper Trader app! Currently it has the basic functionalitly I needed, where clicking to Log In with Discord sends the user to Discord’s authorization page and redirects back to the app with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> parameter needed.
    <ul>
      <li>Note that to prevent a CSRF issue, a random string is generated to append to the Discord Authorization. As things progress, I would like to switch it to be a JWT, but that may not be necessary according to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71810147/discord-oauth2-state-parameter-best-practice">discussion</a> and this <a href="https://evertpot.com/jwt-is-a-bad-default/">article</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Currently testing out a new React router hook, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useSearchParams</code> which will be very helpful for the next step when sending a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> request to the Discord API. Not sure yet if I’ll have the Discord redirect to a new route which will call post to the Discord API, or include it in the Home page <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useEffect</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="learningsthoughts">Learnings/Thoughts</h3>
<p><strong>Axios Post Request</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>As I spent more time looking into the <a href="https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro">Axios API</a>, and multiple Stack Overflow discussions, it seems like my approach is the best way to achieve what I want to do. My current assumption for why is because Axios posting tries to send the values I want in the body rather than as URL parameters. The simplest fix is to use string template literals to build up the URL string explicitly in the Axios post function.
    <ul>
      <li>A small tweak would be to change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redirect_uri</code> to also be a string template literal and have the value be based on the environmental variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I will need to add the second portion of the Discord OAuth functionality which is accessing the user’s Discord information. At the moment I only have the authorization code for the user’s information, but need to send that along with other information to the Discord API.</li>
  <li>In addition, there will need to be some refactoring to properly separate the concerns of storing the user information and breaking down some components such that they aren’t too big.</li>
</ol>
